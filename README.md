This project demonstrates advanced data consolidation and visualization in Excel, highlighting skills in data transformation and dashboard creation. I began by using the XLOOKUP function to seamlessly merge data from multiple datasets, alongside the INDEX function to combine complex and tedious data sources into a cohesive view. Once unified, I transformed the data into pivot tables to create an interactive dashboard.

The dashboard features intuitive slicers and timeline controls, allowing users to filter data by month, year, and specific criteria like roast type (Dark, Light, Medium), size, and loyalty card status. Visualizations, including dynamically updating graphs, provide clear insights on total sales trends over time, sales distribution by country, and the top five customers. This Excel dashboard is designed for ease of use and detailed, accessible insights, showcasing my ability to turn raw data into actionable visual analysis
